= Examples of guard clauses from https://github.com/apache/commons-lang[Apache Commons]'s library =

Apache commons is a multi-role library. Its https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/Validate.java[Validate.java] class is designed to serve as guard clauses.

Guard clauses are build as such: `Validate.[Condition]([tested value].[optional message].[optional value(s) for the formatted message])`. The conditions are large panel of check (from `isTrue` to `noNullElements`).

As they are guard clauses, in order to test them, we will create a small private class, and use these clauses inside the different methods to prevent any issue caused by the user.

Since the test are going to be necessarily false for them to work, we will use try-catch blocks to catch the exception, and throw errors if these exception aren't caught.

== Private class: ==

The `StudentGrade` class consist of an `ArrayList` of `Double`, the different grades of a student, and methods to interact with them.

        for (Double each : grades) {
            Validate.isTrue(each >= 0.0, "A grade cannot be lesser than 0: %d", each.longValue());

        return divisor / divider;

== Tests on StudentGrade: ==

All these tests are destined to fail, hence the use of `fail("This test is supposed to fail");` and `catch ([expectedException] expected) {}` statements.
