= Examples of Preconditions from the https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] library =

Guava is a set of core Java libraries from Google that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, and utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, caching, primitives, strings, and more. It is widely used on most Java projects within Google, and widely used by many other companies as well

.*These examples are to test the main utilities regarding preconditions provided by this library :*

** *Using and avoiding null*: null can be ambiguous, can cause confusing errors, and is sometimes just plain unpleasant. Many Guava utilities reject and fail fast on nulls, rather than accepting them blindly.

** Guava provides a number of precondition checking utilities in the https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/base/Preconditions.java[Preconditions] class.
