= Examples of Preconditions from the https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] library =


[sidebar]
== Presentation
====
Guava is a set of core Java libraries from Google that includes new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, and utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, caching, primitives, strings, and more. It is widely used on most Java projects within Google, and widely used by many other companies as well.

== Characteristics
====
Guava provides a number of *precondition checking utilities* in the https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/base/Preconditions.java[Preconditions] class and there is 3 variants for each method.
This class contains static methods that can help to check whether it was invoked correctly (that is, whether its preconditions were met).
If the precondition is not met, the Preconditions method throws an unchecked exception to a specified type, which helps the method in which the exception was thrown communicate that its caller has made a mistake.

== Variants
====
*As we said, each precondition method has 3 variants :*
[square]
* One with no extra arguments
* An extra Object argument. Any exception is thrown with the error message object.toString().

== Preconditions
[source,asciidoc]
|===
|Signature (not including extra args) |Description |Exception thrown on failure

|checkArgument(boolean)
|Checks that the boolean is true. Use for validating arguments to methods.
|IllegalArgumentException

|checkNotNull(T)
|Checks that the value is not null. Returns the value directly, so you can use checkNotNull(value) inline.
|NullPointerException

|checkState(boolean)
|Checks some state of the object, not dependent on the method arguments. For example, an Iterator might use this to check that next has been called before any call to remove.
|IllegalStateException

|checkElementIndex(int index, int size)
|Checks that index is a valid element index into a list, string, or array with the specified size. An element index may range from 0 inclusive to size exclusive. You don't pass the list, string, or array directly; you just pass its size. Returns index.
|IndexOutOfBoundsException

|checkPositionIndex(int index, int size)
|Checks that index is a valid position index into a list, string, or array with the specified size. A position index may range from 0 inclusive to size inclusive. You don't pass the list, string, or array directly; you just pass its size. Returns index.
|IndexOutOfBoundsException

|checkPositionIndexes(int start, int end, int size)
|Checks that start and end both are in the range [0, size] (and that end is at least as large as start). Comes with its own error message.
|IndexOutOfBoundsException
