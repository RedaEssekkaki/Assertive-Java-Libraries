= Example assertions =

This repository holds a java projects which aims to provide examples
of how multiple libraries allow to create assertions. These libraries include https://github.com/google/guava[Guava] ,
https://github.com/apache/commons-lang[Apache Commons],
https://github.com/google/truth[Truth] & http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/[AssertJ] as well as
https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/E203173Q/commons[the one we are currently building] as an extension to
https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/atlanmod/commons/[Atlanmod Commons].

== Examples : ==

A few examples of how to use each library.

== Direct Comparisons ==

Direct comparisons of how each library is used to create the same suite of tests.
