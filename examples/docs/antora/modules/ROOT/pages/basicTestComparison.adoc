= Basic tests comparisons =

== In this section we provide a comparison of the different libraries on an instance of basic tests made on a class

=== Presentation of the class ===
We used the `Dwarf` class to make our tests :

This class has the following fields : `String name; private double size; private double weight; private boolean hasBeard; private boolean hasHangover; SongRepository knownSongs` +
SongRepository is a helper class used to encapsulate a Collection. Its methods for modification are package protected and usable only by the dwarf whereas all methods that do not modify the collection are public.

=== Comparisons of the tests ===

==== testConstructor ====
This test is to ensure that the constructor properly sets the object's fields

==== testSize ====
This test ensures that `getSize()` and `setSize()` works as intended

==== testWeight ====
This test ensures that `getWeight()` and `setWeight()` works as intended

==== testBeard ====
This test ensures that `shave()`,`growBeard()` and `isBearded()` works as intended

==== testHungover ====
This test ensures that the hungover field is properly set by the dwarf going to the tavern and sleeping

==== testSongs ====
This test ensures that the learned songs get updated when a dwarf learns a song & goes to the tavern (which causes him to forget a song and sing it).
This also ensures that the song is properly printed when sang.
